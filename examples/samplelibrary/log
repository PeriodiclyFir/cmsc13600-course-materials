Let us create a new django project, copy the three files containing sample code `models.py`, `views.py` and `urls.py`, and get it running.

django-admin startproject samplelibrary
cd samplelibrary 
python manage.py startapp library
copy views.py and models.py into samplelibrary/library 
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
# great
python manage.py shell
copy urls.py into samplelibrary/library
modify   samplelibrary/urls.py  to include :
 	from django.urls import path
	urlpatterns = [ 
	...
	  path('', include('library.urls')),  # Route root URL to your app
	 ]
and modify samplelibrary/samplelibrary/urls.py to include
	INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'library' 
	]
Now 
python manage.py shell
lets me interact with the python objects, and 
python manage.py runserver
will cause the server to run.
